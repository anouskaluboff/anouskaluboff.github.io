          <li>The British Library's catalogue traces the magazine that became Land and Water back to 1862, with the founding of the "town and country newspaper" known as The Sporting Gazette. According to the British Library's tracing, the magazine continued in 1879 as The Sporting Gazette and Agricultural Journal, in 1880 as The County Gentleman, Sporting Gazette and Agricultural Journal, then in 1903 as The County Gentleman, in 1905 as The County Gentleman and Land & Water, and from 19167–1920 as Land and Water.<br>
          In 1914, the magazine's coverage shifted to World War I. After the end of the war, the journal continued covering world events, such as the Treaty of Versailles and the Russian Civil War, where Belloc strongly supported an intervention to crush the Bolsheviks. However, in 1920 it ceased publication, and was absorbed by The Field, thus returning to its sporting roots. The Field is still published today.</li>
          <li>Pavel Nikolayevich Miliukov (or Milyukov) (Russian January [O.S. 15 January] 1859 – 31 March 1943) was a Russian historian and liberal politician. His name is sometimes rendered in English as Paul Miliukov or Paul Milukoff.[1] Milyukov was the founder, leader, and the most prominent member of the Constitutional Democratic party (known as the Kadets). In the Russian Provisional Government, he served as Foreign Minister, working to prevent Russia's exit from the First World War.</li>
          <li>Russian Economic Society, so a Fellow of, probably simply a member. It so happens that it was not known by that name but as the Free (Volnoe) Economic Society of Russia - to which most economists of any standing belonged. It was founded in 1765 and disbanded by the Bolsheviks soon after the Revolution in 1918. It was broad in its membership, from Tsarist officials to so-called 'legal-Marxists' - the Free was to indicate that it was open to all who had an interest in Russia having a flourishing economy. It was reestablished in the late Soviet years and in 1992 became once again the Volnoe Economic Society, headed by a leading economist, for a time mayor of Moscow, Gavriil Popov, and is once again very active, with its own journal.</li>
