    <h2>Edouard as a public speaker</h2>
    <p>My research shows that Edouard was a regular speaker at both Public Meeting (“Town Hall”) events and at more private (by invitation) events held at private clubs.</p>
    <p>The references to such events which have [so far] been identified cover 1919 and the 1920’s and show Edouard travelling the length and breadth of the country to speak out on Russian affairs – mainly on <q>the dangers and evils of Bolshevism</q>.</p>

    <p>The meeting in Cardiff in July 1919 deserves special mention and was written up in some detail in the The Russian (Vol. 1, No. 41 dated 24 July 1919).</p>
    <p>It is worth repeating much of the editorial notes and comments:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <h4>Meeting at the Cory Hall, Cardiff under the auspices of the British Empire Union.<sup>2</sup></h4>
      <p>… the principal interruptions occurred during the speech of Mr Edouard S. Luboff, the Editor of The Russian, who answered his critics with much vehemence and whose powerful, full-toned voice was frequently of service to him in making the voices of the interrupters more or less inaudible. <span class="highlight">It was apparent, however, that the strain upon him was more than he could stand and he had ultimately to pay the penalty for his vigorous attacks by apologising for the fact that his constitution would not allow him to proceed further in this manner.</span></p>
      <p>…the Bolshevik forces howled like wild beasts. When he was able to proceed he remarked that Bolshevism had produced a state of misery that was indescribable in Russian and he asserted that as a result of it the death rate in maternity wards was between 80 and 90%.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">…if my friend has read the history of the revolution my name should be familiar to him. On my back I bear the marks of my fight against Czarism and I have suffered in the mines of Siberia for freedom, justice and liberty…… I am prepared to fight Bolshevism as I fought Czarism.</span></p>
      <p>… I don’t like Bolshevism because I don’t like rat meat, and because I don’t like to see women and children starving. If you English Bolsheviks like those things, go to Russia.</p>

    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>He states that his name should be included in records of the revolution – February ?!</li>
      <li>He was a Representative of The Worker’s Association and People’s Party of Russia</li>
      <li>His health was clearly not good from when arrived in the UK but nevertheless he appears to have regularly, during the 1920s in particular, been the principal speaker at many public Town Hall meetings and private club events</li>
      <li>He actively fought Czarism and appears to have been physically mistreated for this</li>
      <li>He stated that he had suffered in the mines of Siberia – and it would appear that he was actually a prisoner of the Czar but also a Russian refugee escaped from a Bolshevik prison.</li>
      <li>He has the letters F.R.E.S. after his name - not clear what qualification or membership this refers to</li>

        <li>British Empire Union : The British Empire Union (BEU) was created in the United Kingdom during the First World War, in 1916, after changing its name from the Anti-German Union, which had been founded in April 1915. From December 1922 to summer 1952, it published a regular journal It stood for patriotism, social reform, industrial peace, promotion of the Empire and anti-socialism.
          <br>On 28 July 1916 the Vice-Presidents of the BEU, Lord and Lady Bathurst, subscribed to a full-page advertisement in The Morning Post stating their objectives:
          <ol type="i">
            <li>To consolidate the British Empire and to develop Trade and Commerce within the Empire and with our Allies.</li>
            <li>To alter our existing naturalisation laws to render it impossible for aliens seeking naturalisation to become British citizens so long as they remain subjects of other countries. This is to apply to existing cases.</li>
            <li>To pursue an Educational propaganda throughout the country in furtherance of the policies that have been expounded by Mr. W. M. Hughes [Prime Minister of Australia]; to establish branches in every constituency and county, and to support candidates pledged to these policies in both the country and in the House of Commons; to urge the importance of the measures proposed to assist the more vigorous prosecution of the war, and to bring about its speedy and satisfactory termination, and to controvert the false economic doctrine so aptly described as 'Laissez-faire'.</li>
          </ol>
          In 1936, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia attacked the BEU as the main opponent of socialism in Britain, which the BEU proudly quoted in its Report: "No other society was mentioned". In 1960, it was renamed the British Commonwealth Union and was taken over by a group of directors in 1975, who ceased its political activities.</li>
