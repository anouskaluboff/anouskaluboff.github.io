    <h2>Approach to Research and Next Steps</h2>
    <p>For many years I have been fascinated by the life and times of my paternal grandfather, Dr. Edouard S. Luboff, whilst being frustrated by the lack of information we have ever been given about him from our Grandmother and indeed our dear Father!</p>
    <p>My research really started in earnest back in 2010 when I was very lucky indeed to be introduced to Peter Matthews (ex- Secretary to The Foreign Press Association). Peter was an experienced researcher and was clearly intrigued by Edouard’s story. With his amazing help, assisted by some student researchers under his wing and guidance, I was able to start the journey and begin to gather together some vital information and documentary evidence about the life and times of Edouard.</p>
    <p>Copies of books, pamphlets etc written by Edouard have been sourced from all over the world. The British Library has provided 43 issues of The Russian journal for me to read cover to cover. The Daily Mail archives have provided me with many copies of articles and letters written by Edouard. The ‘World Wide Webb’ has also been my constant companion and friend!</p>
    <p>Progress was always slow and rather intermittent. However, in 2017 I have been fortunate enough to take a six week sabbatical from work which has allowed me to spend some concentrated and quality time in pulling together the various strands of documentary evidence I had already collated whilst locating more books, booklets, articles written by Edouard.</p>
    <p>During this period I have now read all of the books and articles and provided my own summaries in order to hopefully provide more colour on Edouard and his views, beliefs and theories.</p>
    <p>Spending time at The British Library and in my study I have now managed to produce this first edition of a personal Biographical Memorandum on my grandfather, Dr. Edouard S. Luboff, LL.D, F.R.E.S.</p>
    <p>I had already started building this web site to Edouard – www.edouardluboff.com – to populate with all of the new material collected and the Memorandum I have written. I hope to have the ‘e-archive’ up and running in live mode as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>I hope that this may generate interest from around the globe and help me with the Phase 2 of this project.</p>
    <p><strong>I emphasise again to the reader that this is only a first edition as I hope to continue my research and, as well as trying to complete the jigsaw of his life and activities whilst living in the UK from (say) 1917 until his death in 1947, I will be aiming to track down his elusive past back in Russia and maybe even, (hopefully and with a fair wind), locate the “Luboffs” he left behind.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I take all responsibility for spelling and grammatical errors and indeed poor formatting in this document for I am no English scholar.</strong></p>
