    <h2>Edouard as a journalist and press correspondent</h2>
    <p>My research has identified that Edouard wrote regularly for the Daily Mail between 1926 and 1933 and was attributed his own byline for these articles. He also wrote a number of letters to the Editor of the Daily Mail during this period.
A number of articles have also been found in other newspapers across the globe.
The subjects covered included Russian society, poverty, the Bolsheviks, Russian leaders and a number of travelogues - showing his roots as a socio-political specialist, an economic commentator and an expert on economic trade.
I have now obtained copies of these articles from the Daily Mail archives and through the good offices of Suzanne Barnes these have been typed up and as far as possible we have attempted to identify certain words and phrases which have been difficult to read.
The table below provides a list of the various articles and letters to the Editor of the Daily Mail – an eclectic collection – with my own comments and observations:</p>
