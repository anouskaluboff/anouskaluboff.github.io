    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>I would first of all like to record a big thank you to Peter Matthews (formerly Secretary of The Foreign Press Association) who, with his band of student researchers, found such a lot of wonderful material for me in 2010 when this research journey began. He was a gentleman and a scholar.</p>
    <p>I would also like to thank family and friends for their support throughout this research adventure, including Suzanne Hewitt (nee Barnes) who typed up a lot of the documents in order that the reader could actually read the documentary evidence collated.</p>
    <p>I am indebted to a number of libraries and bookshops throughout the world who have been kind enough to provide me with copies of Edouard’s work. It has been fascinating to find out where these books have found a resting place!</p>
    <p>My thanks also go to Professor Julian Cooper, Dr. Katya Rogatchevskaia, Charlotte Alston, David Crawshaw, Ian Thomas and Ralph Gibson.</p>
