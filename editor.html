    <h2>Edouard as an Editor (“The Russian”) and Publisher (“Anglo-Russian Press Association”)</h2>
      <h3>“The Russian” – A weekly Journal devoted to Russian affairs</h3>
        <h4>Background:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The Russian was a weekly journal devoted to Russian affairs and published by The Russian Newspapers Ltd.</li>
          <li>Edouard was both the founder and editor of The Russian and a regular contributor of articles on a variety of subjects, including Siberia. INSERT IMAGE</li>
          <li>It was available from WH Smith and other book shops at a single copy price of 6d or an annual subscription of 25s. INSERT IMAGE</li>
          <li>The first issue was 15 October 1918.</li>
          <li>The British Library hold copies of (only) the first 43 issues of The Russian (in both English and Cyrillic) with issue 43 having an issue date of 7 August 1919. My big thanks go to Dr. Katya Rogatchevskaia of The British Library who helped locate these for me.</li>
          <li>In Issue 39 there is a claim that the journal has a circulation of 5,000 but in Issue 31 (Pg 1) there is a claim that circulation is now up to 10,000 per week with the largest part directed to ‘Non-Bolshevik Russia’! INSERT IMAGE</li>
          <li>It is unclear how long The Russian was published for but we have one reference stating that at a speech by Edouard in January 1920, at a meeting of the Edinburgh branch of the BEU, he was described as “Editor of The Russian” and another reference that at a speech by Edouard on 13 October 1924 he was described as “former editor of The Russian”.</li>
          <li>The publishing and editorial offices of The Russian started at 17 Southampton Street, WC1 and in [XXXX] had moved to Goschen Buildings, 12 & 13 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, WC2.</li>
          <li>The weekly journal contained the following standard sections:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Round up of weekly news items</li>
              <li>Editorial piece</li>
              <li>Letters to the Editor</li>
              <li>Repeat of statement of objectives for the journal – see below</li>
              <li>Reprint of relevant articles from newspapers around the world</li>
              <li>Reviews of books</li>
              <li>Records of public meetings held</li>
              <li>Economic and trade section</li>
              <li>Advertisements and notices</li>
          </ul>
          <li>INSERT IMAGE<sup>1</sup></li>
          <li>It also contained a whole series of cartoons by cartoonist Jack Walker<sup>1</sup> such as this one below – note the inclusion of The Russian on the bottom right hand side: INSERT IMAGE<sup>1</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Approach:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I have reviewed, at The British Library, all 43 issues of The Russian held there.</li>
          <li>The objective has been to:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>find out more about The Russian as a publication itself</li>
              <li>identify articles written by Edouard included in the publication</li>
              <li>extract any personal data about Edouard – his background, his political views and social identifiers</li>
              <li>identify any other people or organisations/institutions who/which might be relevant for further investigation in order to build a profile of Edouard</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Founder of the Anglo-Russian Press Association</h3>
        <p>It has not been possible to-date to find out any significant information about the formation, activities and life span of this Press Association. This is rather surprising but I am hopeful that further research will uncover some more detail about the founding, ownership and activities of this association.</p>
        <p>What we do know is that a number of Edouard’s books, booklets and pamphlets were in fact published by the Anglo-Russian Press Association – recorded in a separate place in this memorandum – but we have not yet researched whether this association also published other books for other authors during this period.</p>
        <p>Edouard was, however, clearly very involved with this organisation and so it could provide more detail on Edouard’s activities in due course.</p>

        <p>Rather a repeat of the comments above.</p>
        <p>It has not been possible to-date to find out any significant information about the formation, activities and life span of this publication. This is again rather surprising but I am hopeful that further research will uncover some more detail about the founding, ownership and activities of this organisation.</p>
        <p>What we do know is that a number of Edouard’s books, booklets and pamphlets were in fact published by the Anglo-Russian News – recorded in a separate place in this memorandum – but we have not yet researched whether this company also published other books for other authors during this period.</p>
        <p>For example The Soviets in 1925, a 48 page memorandum written by Edouard in January 1926, was issued by the Anglo-Russian News (from 23-28 Fleet Street).</p>
        <p>Edouard was, however, clearly very involved with this organisation and so it could provide more detail on Edouard’s activities in due course.</p>
        <h3>Anglo-Russian Economic Society</h3>
        <p>All we really know so-far about this society is that it published “Russian Trade – A Constructive Policy”, a 31 page document written by Edouard in 1933.</p>
        <p>We will add this to our list of organisations to be researched further in Phase 2.</p>
        <p><strong>Footnote:</strong> The Russian Liberation Committee (“RLC”) in London. This was one of the most active of the Russian émigré organisations operating in London in the period following the Russian Revolution.</p>
        <p>An excellent paper has been produced on the RLC by Charlotte Alston. It is interesting and perhaps rather surprising to note that there is no mention of Edouard, The Russian or The Anglo-Russian Press Association in this paper as surely Edouard knew the individuals involved in this Committee? More research to be carried out and I have now established contact with Charlotte who I am sure will be able to help me in this endeavour.</p>
        <blockquote><p>“The Russian Liberation Committee was one of the most active of the Russian émigré organizations operating in London in the period following the Russian Revolution. It acted as a clearing house for news on the Russian civil war, receiving telegrams from each of the fronts and distributing them to the British press. It also produced a variety of publications of its own, for distribution to the public, government officials and to soldiers in Russia.</p>
        <p>In this article, the Committee’s work and publications are examined for the light they shed on anti-Bolshevik propaganda in Britain, and on the sources of information on the civil war available to the British press. While the Committee’s efforts could not alter the pragmatic policy of the British government or the already anti-Bolshevik attitude of the British press, their presence made an important difference to the amount and kind of information that was available in Britain during the course of the Russian civil war.”</p></blockquote>
