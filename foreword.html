    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>This is indeed a fascinating, if at times rather frustrating, journey and voyage of discovery! From the barest of information (generally un-validated) passed down orally from my Father and paternal Grandmother I started to become intrigued about the ‘life and times’ of my paternal Grandfather, Dr. Edouard S. Luboff.</p>
    <p>If our collective memories serve us correctly all we were told was the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edouard was Russian but more particularly it was claimed he was a Georgian</li>
      <li>He had been sent to the Siberian mines by the Bolsheviks from which he escaped in
      a ‘pickled herring barrel’ on a train !!</li>
      <li>He had some involvement with Kerensky’s Provisional Government</li>
      <li>He had the title Doctor and was probably a lawyer</li>
      <li>He met my Grandmother - Evelyn - in England and was a lot older than her</li>
      <li>They had a son, Andrei, but only one child</li>
      <li>Was in Germany for the ticker-tape parade by the allies at the end of WW2</li>
      <li>Edouard was sickly in later life and Edouard and Evelyn had separated before his
      death</li>
      <li>Ended up ‘mushroom farming’ in Surrey!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have always had an interest in the econ-political world and indeed read Economics and Politics at University. Further, the physical likeness passed down the Luboff family, particularly on the male side has always said very clearly to me that the Russian blood courses strongly through our veins and our genes have inherited a significant dose of the Luboff DNA.</p>
    <p>A long time ago in my twenties a friend of mine returned from a holiday in Spain with a bottle of Vodka Luboff (see below). I still have the bottle but he had generously thought to have drunk all the vodka before giving it to me! For at least a week or so I imagined that I might have been the heir to a long lost vodka empire but have failed to be able to track it down and whether it is still in existence!!
    </p>
    <h3>Evidence collated and collected to-date</h3>
    <p>To date I have managed to locate and collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[8] books and pamphlets written (or co-authored) by Edouard</li>
      <li>The first 43 weekly issues of <span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span> – a weekly journal available to the public (held in
      the British Library) – founded and edited by Edouard</li>
      <li>[47] articles and letters written by Edouard for <span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> and also included in a number
      of other newspaper publications/journals</li>
      <li>[10] announcements and reviews in local newspapers of Edouard making public and private
      speeches at Town Hall and Private club meetings</li>
      <li>a very few photos and items of correspondence</li>
      <li>death certificates, will and probate statement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using this documentary evidence and rather scant personal information I have attempted to put together a time line for Edouard and to build an outline profile of the man.</p>
    <h3>The debate about the Surname?!</h3>
    <p>There has always been quite a debate about Edouard’s surname and whether or not he (perhaps) changed his name on the boat coming over to England. Further, whether or not the surname “Luboff” could support the contention that he was of Georgian origin?</p>
    <p>The research currently indicates the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The surname Luboff (meaning Love) is much more of a Russian name than a Georgian name
        <br><em>“Luboff, Lubov or Lyubov is indeed a Russia name (means 'love') but if one does a search on Yandex, the excellent Russian search engine, it fails to bring up anything of relevance.”<sup>1</sup></em>
      </li>
      <li>There were plenty of Russians with the letters “off” at the end of their surnames during this period such as M Nabokoff, President of The Russian Advisory Council (to the Central Russian Committee). Many names of this convention are mentioned in issues of The Russian.</li>
      <li>So far I have found nothing which provides us with the answer as to what Edouard’s middle initial, “S”, stands for. Edouard may not have had much time for middle names as he did not provide one for his son Andrei!</li>
      <li>A marvellous find from Issue 15 (Pg. 13) of <span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span> dated 21/01/19 – see below – identifies, for the first time, a named “relative” of Edouard’s – M.B.Luboff – with the same surname. This is an awesome discovery as it strongly suggests that Edouard left behind him somewhere in the USSR a family of Luboffs. Further, in Issue 1 of <span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span> it is noted that one M Luboff is the Hon Sec of the The Russian Advisory Council (to the Central Russian Committee) and Russian Press Representative.</li>
      <li>The only well known Luboff in the public arena appears to be Norman Luboff.<sup>2</sup> Norman was born in Chicago but could be a useful individual to research further to try and identify his family background and heritage.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My good friend David Crawshaw, who has spent a lot of time working out in Russia, came up with this fascinating and very helpful summary:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“So – my high level research does indeed show that that it is quite a rare name. It seems that the stem for your surname comes from Lyuby – which has its origins as a Medieval Slavic name. Trying to piece things together, it seems the names Lyubov/ Lyubova are a derivation of Lyuby. Both these names seem to be most popular in Russia/Ukraine and from the little I know, with the ‘a’ on the end of Lyubova, that would be in keeping with Russian names from Ukraine/Western Russia region.</p>
      <p>It also seems that over the years that the Lyubov/Lyubova names are likely to have generated subsequent names of Lubov, Lyuboff, Lyubof, Lubof, Loboff, and Luboff.</p>
      <p>One other interesting point is that Edouard is not the spelling used in Russia – it is Eduard – spelling <span class="highlight">Эдуард</span> in Russian which is also the same name Georgian – spelt <span class="highlight">მართლწერა</span>!!</p>
      <p>Returning to the Georgian link, I wonder if your forebears moved/were sent from their original homelands to Georgia but in doing so kept their original surnames? I cannot remember if you knew whether your forebears were from Georgia or could have moved to Georgia and whether that we pre or post the Stalin era?</p>
      <p>Certainly when Stalin transported ethnic populations around Russia, in an attempt to prevent nationalistic fervour from becoming a threat to him, it was not uncommon for those moved away from their native lands, to be given new surnames, often the common names of families in the areas to which they were moved. More interestingly, after the death of Stalin many of those who were transported away from their homelands, quietly started to change their names back to their birth names and also started to migrate back to their homelands.</p>
      <p>As a final bit of info, it seems that the country with the highest frequency ratio of Luboff's as a population surname is South Africa, which would seem to indicate either a migration of Luboff’s away from Russian/Ukrainian homelands to South Africa, or one or two Luboff’s who ended up there.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The debate about Religious faith?</h3>
    <p>The name does not necessarily suggest that Edouard was Jewish. The physical appearance, passed down the generations, has resulted in many people assuming that the Luboffs are of the Jewish faith!</p>
    <p>There is in fact no indication that Edouard religiously followed the Jewish faith. Indeed, Andrei his son was agnostic at best or maybe even atheist. Andrei’s family was brought up as low level C of E.</p>
    <p>However, a couple of references in issues of <span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span> are of interest.</p>
    <p>In issue 32 there is a comment that the Jewish element in Bolshevism is very small, whilst the bulk of Jewry in Russia – and elsewhere too – is putting forth all its strength against Bolshevism as a menace to the world. The tone of this comment could indicate that Edouard was in fact Jewish although this may be by family/birth rather than being an actively practising Jew.</p>
    <p>Certainly does not appear to have wanted his son to be brought up in the Jewish faith.</p>
    <p>In issue 36 there is a reference to a personal attack on Edouard, as Editor of <span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span>, by the newly launched Russian Outlook journal. The journal insinuates that <q>he [Edouard] is a Jew</q> – this contention is not actually denied in the commentary ?</p>
    <h3>The early years - pre-1918 and Edouard arriving permanently into the UK</h3>
    <p>So what do we know about Edouard’s life before 1918 when we find him having arrived in England?</p>
    <p>Not much unfortunately – some mere scraps provide us with the following sketchy outline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> article (17/01/28) states that Edouard knew Stalin in his early days – but did his description of Stalin as a “lanky youth” actually ring true ?! If true this could certainly indicate that Edouard lived in Georgia, at least in his youth.</li>
      <li>He was often described in articles and public speaking announcements as a <q>Russian Barrister/Former Member of the Russian Bar</q>. The letters LL.D after his name on certain publications indicates that he was a qualified lawyer – ‘Legum Doctor of Law’</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> article (13/03/28) describes Edouard as <q>the well- known Russian economist and traveller, who went to Kabul on a mission of investigation before the war</q>. The letters F.R.E.S often quoted after his name we now believe probably stand for Fellow of the Russian Economic Society</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> article (06/10/28) includes a comment where Edouard reports that he came across many beautiful [Russian] spies in <q>the difficult years of 1905 and 1906</q> – the first Revolution years</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span> (issue 41, 24/07/19), describing a speech he made in Cardiff, quotes him as saying <q>…if my friend has read the history of the revolution [continued Mr Luboff] my name should be familiar to him. On my back I bear the marks of my fight against Czarism and I have suffered in the mines of Siberia for freedom, justice and liberty. I am anxious to see my country ruled in a democratic way and I am prepared to fight Bolshevism as I fought Czarism.</q></li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Sevenoaks Chronicle</span> report of a public speech made by Edouard (02/26) describes Edouard as <q>Dr Edouard Luboff, FRES, formerly Member of the Ex-People’s Party of Russia, a Russian refugee escaped from a Bolshevik prison</q>.</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> article (13/03/28) provides a description by Edouard of a trip he made to Kabul <q>before the war</q> – so before 1914. It also states that he had previously made a trip to Teheran in Persia</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> article (01/11/27) states that in 1914 he was working for the Russian Ministry of Interior</li>
      <li>The Daily Mail article (01/11/27) describes Edouard as “Assistant Compiler of ‘Asiatic Russia’ a remarkable compendium issued by the Russian Ministry of Interior in 1914”</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> article (21/06/17) quotes from the Land and Water publication Edouard’s article about Professor Pavel Milyukov – where exactly was Edouard when he was writing this article?</li>
      <li><span class="pubTitles">The Russian</span> Issue 40, Pg1 (17/10/19) states that Edouard had made a first visit to South Wales in 1916?!
    </ul>
    <p>In the book written by Edouard entitled <span class="pubTitles">A Red Year – The Soviets in 1926</span>, Edouard claims that:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>...he is not a politician, either in the Russian or British sense. He belongs to no Party and subscribes to no programme; his sole desire is to show that the Soviet system, both politically and economically is unsound, not because I bear any malice to Soviet leaders, but because the results have turned a progressive country into a backward country.</p>
        <p>For years my work was devoted to the extension of Russian industry, commerce and finance in co-operation with this country [Britain]. I fought for modern ideas of commerce because I saw that, by coming into line with progressive European countries, Russia could become wealthier and happier.</p>
        <p>This book is, therefore, not “a plea for Czarism”, an accusation levelled against me by a Labour reviewer of my previous efforts, nor is it “a hazardous throw for intervention”, another accusation.</p>
        <p>It is to show that “antagonism of classes” must lead to “antagonism of nations” and that all antagonism is a social and economic evil.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>So how can we summarise the above?</h3>
    <p>INSERT HERE</p>
    <h3>How did Edouard travel to England?</h3>
    <p>This is still all unclear. Probably by boat so maybe we will be able to locate him on a passenger list if we are lucky. Did he come into London or maybe another UK port?</p>
    <h3>What were his early years in the UK like?</h3>
    <p>Again we have no record of how he started his working life in the UK, who he may have known to help him and where he first of all lived.</p>
    <p>We do know that by early 1918 he had founded the Anglo-Russian Press Association and that he had founded “The Russian”, a weekly journal sold to the public devoted to Russian affairs and published by The Russian Newspapers Ltd. The first issue of The Russian was on 15 October 1918. The publishing and editorial offices of The Russian started at 17 Southampton Street, WC1.</p>
    <h3>Can we summarise the years 1919-1933?</h3>
    <p>INSERT HERE</p>
    <h3>What do we know about Edouard’s life and activities during 1934 – 45 including the WW2 years?</h3>
    <p>To date I have not been able to find any evidence of Edourd’s activities during the war period.</p>
    <p>He was of course over 60 years of age during this period.</p>
    <p>It appears that he had stopped writing for the Daily Mail around 1933 and the last book he published was also in 1933.</p>
    <p>Further, a letter to the Editor of <span class="pubTitles">The Daily Mail</span> in February 1933:</p>
    <p><q>praised an article by Dr Beron Wolfe on factors and treatments for nervous breakdowns. Interestingly he starts by saying “Those who have suffered the agonies of a nervous breakdown…</q> ***formatting??***</p>
    <h3>How did Edouard live in his last few years and how did he die?</h3>
    <p>It would appear that Edouard did not see his son Andrei [Andrey] very much and indeed Edouard died when Andrei was only aged 20.</p>
    <p>A short and overall rather sad letter survives from Edouard to his son on his 20th birthday (8th May 1947), only in fact two months before Edouard’s death on the 13th July 1947!</p>
    <p>We know that Edouard was in very poor health in the later stages of his life and that he was cared for full time by a ‘nurse companion’.</p>
    <p>His will was dated 2nd July 1940 and shows Edouard now living at The Manse, Brightwell, Berkshire.</p>
    <p>Edouard’s will shows very clearly just how important his “friend and companion” and nurse, Margaret Ewart (a widow), was to him in his last few years and Edouard left everything to her with a rather inadequate bequest for his son – namely board and lodgings and the British Encyclopaedia which he had already actually given to him on his thirteenth birthday !!</p>
    <p>IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>The Probate certificate – dated XXX – shows that Edouard was living at the time of his death at 58 Warwick Gardens, Kensington.</p>
    <p>It also shows that he left to Margaret Ewart a net estate with a value of £2,182. In today’s money this figure is the equivalent to circa £78,0004. The average price of a house in the UK in 1947 was £1,824.<sup4</sup></p>
    <p>His death certificate shows he died of pneumonia and other complications. It would appear that he died at home at 58 Warwick Gardens, Kensington.</p>
    <h3>Summation</h3>
    <p>Although there is a lot more research to do including, in particular, attempting to trace Edouard’s life and family background before he arrived in the UK, I hope that the reader will find this an interesting thumbnail sketch of a fascinating man.</p>
    <p>Edouard was clearly a very intelligent man, a Barrister-at Law, a well-known economist, an author but more than that it would appear that Edouard was a brave man of strong principles, always prepared to stand up for his beliefs and make sure he was heard, either in print or orally, whatever the risk to his own personal safety and health. There is a sense that at the same time he may have been a difficult man but this is perhaps not unusual in principled individuals.</p>
    <p>There is clearly much to admire and much still to learn.</p>

        <li>The Norman Luboff Choir was among the most popular choral ensembles of their day, releasing a series of hit easy-listening LPs during the late 1950s and 1960s. Luboff was born May 14, 1917 in Chicago, where he began his career as a vocalist and arranger for area radio programs; in 1948 he relocated to Hollywood, signing on to compose movie music for Warner Bros. The first incarnation of the Norman Luboff Choir was formed during the mid-1950s, and in the years to follow they released a series of albums on Columbia that drew on music from a variety of genres and geographic locales, with titles including Calypso Holiday, Broadway!, Songs of the Cowboy and Songs of the Caribbean. The choir also backed a number of vocalists including Harry Belafonte and Doris Day, and although their recording career came to a halt during the late 1960s, they continued touring until Luboff's cancer-related death on September 22, 1987.</li>
