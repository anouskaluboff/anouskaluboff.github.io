    <h2>Edouard as a Family man</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is a difficult section to write as very little information was ever provided to the family by Edouard’s partner or son and almost no pictures or indeed documentation has been found when examining the papers of both Evelyn and Andrei.</p>
    <p>The family tree is therefore at present very bare!</p>
    <p>We have no birth certificate for Edouard as he was not born in England and there is no record of a marriage to Evelyn having taken place so we are required to assume that Edouard and Evelyn were never legally married (at least in the UK).</p>
    <p>From his death certificate, copy of his will and probate statement we have been able to determine some colour on the end period of his life in England.</p>
    <h3>Profile of Edouard</h3>
    <p>This has been built up from the various scraps of documentary evidence which have been found during the research phase.</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>Having been born in 1877 it would appear that Edouard arrived in England either at the end of 1917 or at the beginning of 1918 – certainly the first issue of “The Russian” occurred in October 1918 – but this is not validated or verified.</p>
    <p>He would have been aged [40] at this time.</p>
    <p>At some stage over the next few years he met (Gladys) Eveyln Gates and a relationship was formed.</p>
    <p>We know nothing more about his personal life until 1927 when his son Andrei was born – Edourad was aged 50 at that time (he described himself as a “journalist” on Andrei’s birth certificate) and as well as having written a number of books by that date Edouard was now actively writing articles for the Daily Mail and touring the country speaking at Public and Private meetings on the ‘dangers and evils of Bolshevism’.</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>Andrei was sent off to boarding school in Dorset (partly to help his health) and stayed on at Clayesmore through the war years until leaving at the age of [18].</p>
    <p>It is not clear how often Edouard saw his son or indeed when his relationship with Evelyn ended.</p>
    <p>The picture below appears to show a happy threesome when Andrei was say 17 or maybe even 18 years of age but pictures can lie and we cannot assume categorically that Edouard and Evelyn were still together at that time – say 1944 - 45.</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>With almost no pictures showing the family together and no letters or correspondence between them it remains very unclear as to how the family of three lived their lives and interacted during the period 1927 – 1947 – i.e. from Andrei’s birth to Edouard’s death.</p>
    <p>I have only managed to find one communication – that of a short hand written note from Edouard to Andrei on the occasion of Andrei’s 20th birthday on 8th May 1947 - reproduced in full here.</p>
    <p>A rather sad and gloomy birthday note with, I am sure, the best of intentions.</p>
    <p>Just two months later, on the 13th July 1947, Edouard died at home from Pneumonia and various other complications. It is interesting to note that his son, Andrei registered the death! The death certificate is included as Schedule 1 to this chapter. It appears that he was back living in London at that time.</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>We know that Edouard was in very poor health in the later stages of his life and that he was cared for full time by a ‘nurse companion’.</p>
    <p>His will was dated 2nd July 1940 and shows Edouard living at that time at The Manse, Brightwell, Berkshire.</p>
    <p>The will **** included as Schedule 2 *** shows very clearly just how important his “friend and companion” and nurse, Margaret Ewart (a widow), was to him in his last few years and Edouard left everything to her with a rather inadequate bequest for his son – namely board and lodgings and the British Encyclopaedia which he had already actually given to him on his thirteenth birthday !!</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>The Probate certificate – dated 6 November 1947 – shows that Edouard was living at the time of his death at 58 Warwick Gardens, Kensington. We are not sure where he is buried.</p>
    <p>It also shows that he left to Margaret Ewart a net estate with a value of £2,182. The average price of a house in the UK in 1947 was £1,824.37<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    <p>In today’s money this figure is the equivalent to circa £78,000<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <h3>Profile of Gladys Evelyn Gates</h3>
    <p>Andrei’s Mother was Gladys Evelyn Gates, known as Evelyn.</p>
    <p>She was born on the 17th July 1896 in Norwich and attended Norwich High school.</p>
    <p>Clearly a very bright individual she won many prizes at school and then went on, in [1915], to read History at Newnham College, Cambridge<sup>3</sup> graduating in 1918 with a 2:1 BA degree.</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
    <p>A successful career as a high ranking civil servant was marked by being awarded an OBE in [XXXX]</p>
    <p>In her later years she lived in Seaford with a female companion known to the family as “Auntie K”. She ran a portfolio of residential flats showing her business flair and acumen.</p>
    <p>Evelyn was an amazing person full of genuine warmth and caring beneath a slightly gruff and formal exterior. I used to love to go and stay with her – we used to play mini golf together – but woe betide you if you did not follow her house rules.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately she appeared to have no interest in sharing with us any details of her time with Edouard and therefore a lot of detail and colour about Edouard sadly died with her.</p>
    <p>Evelyn died in 1990 at the grand old age of [93].</p>
    <h3>Profile of the early days of Andrei (Andrey) Luboff</h3>
    <p>Born on 8th May 1927 to Edouard (who was aged 50 at the time) and Evelyn (who was aged 31 at the time).</p>
    <p>An only child …….</p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGE</p>
    <p>Andrei was clearly intelligent and after his early schooling at Elmhurst School in South Croydon he won scholarships to his prep school and senior school (Clayesmore) and then Corpus Christi College, Cambridge where he started by reading Natural Sciences but ended up reading economics.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>INSERT IMAGES HERE</p>
    <p>It would appear that he did not see his father very much and indeed Edouard died when Andrei was only aged 20. At that time Andrei was completing his National Service which included two years in the Military Intelligence Corps rising to the rank of Sergeant.</p>
    <p>A short letter survives from Edouard to his son on his 20th birthday (8th May 1947) – reproduced above – only in fact two months before Edouard’s death on the 13th July 1947!</p>
    <p>We have not been able to find any other correspondence to help us build any sort of picture of the relationship between father and son.</p>
    <p>Physically however, Andrei was clearly Edouard’s son as shown in particularly by a picture of Andrei in an almost identical pose to Edouard in a cartoon of Edouard as Editor of The Russian (dated [XXX] 1919) - shown overleaf. Edouard would have been aged 42 at that time.</p>
    <p>It is also interesting to note that Andrei followed his Father into the area of Industrial Economics. His first job after coming down from Cambridge was for the National Institute of Economics and Social Research. Like Father like Son he specialised in analysing economic trade and company performance. Indeed as an example in 1956 we have evidence that shows Andrei attending the BBC Television Centre to give an interview on “companies engaged in British Industry” – for which he earned himself the grand sum of Five guineas!</p>
