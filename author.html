    <h2>Edouard as an author</h2>
    <p>My research has identified that Edouard – during the 1920s and 1930s - wrote a number of books , booklets and ‘pamphlets’ on Bolshevism, the Russian people and, showing his roots as an economic commentator, on economic trade (and in particular Anglo-Russian trade).</p>
    <p>I have located the following [eight] publications from sources around the world (libraries, rare book shops etc) and the physical archive I have constructed has editions and copies of these books.</p>
    <p>The table below provides a snapshot profile of the publications followed by my own review of each in turn.</p>

To look at Marxian Socialism and its impact on Russia - but from the start the authors state that 'we do not for an instant condone, or do anything but deplore, the horrors of the Revolution.' The Red Flag has been followed by the Red Guards and the Red Terror, and there has been blood all the way.

    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In publications of The Russian in 1919 there were regular announcements that Edouard would shortly be publishing “Siberia: The Eastern El Dorado”. I have not been able to find such a publication. <img src="./resources/images/author09.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></li>
      <li>The Russian in 1919 stated that in preparation was “The British Foreign Trade Directory”. Again I have not been able to find such a document.</li>
      <li>A review in the Belfast news letter dated 22 August, 1922 of the “Industrial Year Book”, edited by Philip Gee refers to various contributors to the 1,000 page document including one by Edouard Luboff. So far I have not been able to track down this publication.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Facts about Bolshevism</h3>
    <p><strong>A short, 15 page, pamphlet written by Edouard in 1919 in his position as General Secretary of The Russian League of Freedom<sup>1</sup> - costing threepence.</strong></p>
    <p>A number of parts of this document have been included in separate parts in issues of The Russian.</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author10.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>It starts with a very gloomy and dismal preface written by Edouard painting a picture of Bolshevik Russia with poverty, hunger, sickness and despair. He almost pleads for England to rescue Russia and not let it die.</p>
    <p>From the Strand in London he ‘longs to fly over my stricken homeland and convey to my people the message of hope …….. oh! my motherland?!<sup>1</sup></p>
    <h4>What is Bolshevism?</h4>
    <p>Bolshevism is in translation “moreism” derived from the word “bolshe” more. It is the theory of the vagabond, as against Socialism the theory of the worker.</p>
    <p>“The Bolshevik does not wish to produce, but only to enjoy and possess, and his solution is to confiscate that which others produce”.</p>
    <h4>Freedom of Association</h4>
    <p>Under a Bolshevik decree all meetings, societies and unions have to meet certain criteria and registration, otherwise they will be considered “counter-revolutionary organisations”.</p>
    <h4>Red Terror</h4>
    <p>Repeats announcements by the Central Executive Committee (2nd November & 31st October 1919) which list a whole series of people who have been shot as counter-revolutionaries including many high ranking military personnel, ex Ministers and Counts.</p>
    <p>[Interesting to note some of the names: Urussoff, Kolosnoff, Karganoff, Bogaroff, Kolvakoff, Volkoff, Popoff… many names ending in ‘off’.]</p>
    <h4>Bolshevik Power</h4>
    <p>What keeps the Bolsheviks in power? … even when there is neither bread nor peace in Russia ?!</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author11.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>Postulated that the Bolshevism took advantage of the situation that the masses could not continue to survive the impact of WW1 and promised them both peace and bread. They incited them to revolt against the “bourgeoise”</p>
    <p>At the same time provocative agitation was carried on by German spies and agents.</p>
    <p>Edouard argues that in fact Bolshevism wields power by terror even without the support of the people!</p>
    <p>They copy every method used by Czarism – in this case the Red Guard, the creation of a large bureaucracy, commissions for stealing State money, torture and blackmail, the control of the Press …</p>
    <h4>The Extraordinary Commission</h4>
    <p>The ‘Tchrezvytchayka’ the Extraordinary Commission for fighting counter-revolution, speculation and sabotage – effectively the successor to the Okhranka (Czars secret police).</p>
    <p>As well as arrests and executions it was also responsible for the control of frontiers, stations and watching over villages with the help of the Committee of Village Poverty.</p>
    <p>Eventually subject to the authority of the Soviet the Commission’s mission was to either shoot or imprison any individuals who were reported to them by agents and spies.</p>
    <h4>Health & Welfare</h4>
    <p>Edouard reports that the hospitals of Petrrograd and Moscow have lost their medical staff owing to the impossible conditions and controls exercised over them. Vital medicines and surgical instruments have been stolen.</p>
    <p>The country has taken to all kinds of mad experiments leading to high death rates, especially amongst children, typhus and other deadly diseases.</p>
    <p>The so called “democratisation” of the medical profession has resulted in hospital porters being elected as doctors and other lower staff able to over-rule professional staff!</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author12.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <h4>Land and Industry</h4>
    <p>Under the first land decree instead of land being given to the poor landless peasants it was taken by the peasantry already rich who found it easier to actually work the land of the former estate owners – thus an increasing amount of land actually remained untiled!</p>
    <p>Further, the peasants could not manage these bigger estates and did not now have access to suitable machinery – all leading to a fall in production yields. Forests were felled and even burned to increase arable land …. The sugar, starch and wine industries were all ruined by these measures.</p>
    <p>Still greater were the losses in the mining and manufacturing industries.</p>
    <p>“the Bolshevik policy has proved a decided failure”</p>
    <p>Interestingly Edouard suggests that the peasantry, les exhausted than the town population, show more energy in their opposition to Bolshevism with regular uprisings and revolts having to be put down by the Red Guards.</p>

    <h3>Bolshevik Russia</h3>
    <p><strong>A 192 page book on Bolshevik Russia by G.E.Raine<sup>1</sup> in collaboration with Edouard Luboff, LL.D first published in 1920 by Nisbet & Co. Ltd.</strong></p>
    <blockquote><p>The aim of the book was to explore and examine Russia of 1920 - the peoples and their characteristics; their spiritual, social and industrial setting. To look at Marxian Socialism and its impact on Russia - but from the start the authors state that 'we do not for an instant condone, or do anything but deplore, the horrors of the Revolution.' The Red Flag has been followed by the Red Guards and the Red Terror, and there has been blood all the way.</p></blockquote>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author13.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:50%;"> <img src="./resources/images/author14.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:50%;"></p>
    <p>The introduction talks about the importance of not viewing Russians as wholly European, the Russian problem is a whole-world problem – “the Soviet state must be studied in the fullest detail as if it is good then it will not end in Russia and if it be evil it must not begin in any other land.”</p>
    <blockquote><p>The Englishman has a traditional disinclination for concerning himself with foreign countries. He has been accustomed to sum up their national characteristics in a phrase - usually more or less offensive and relegate them to their place on the map. Hitherto he has known little of world history and cared less. For him, his own has been the only country that counts.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The aim of the book is consider the results as much if not more than the machinery of the Revolution.</p>
    <p>The challenges are that any visit to Russia is influenced by the over bearing hospitality, the opposition press has been suppressed and silenced, the facts provided by the State are questionable – there is not so much Free Speech as Free Prison !!</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author15.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

    <blockquote><p><strong>Britannia – 25 January 1929</strong>
    <br>Letter from B H Tubbs – arguing that Bolshevism did not in fact find its expression and recognition among Russian people, i.e. that Bolshevism was born in Russia but quotes Bolshevik Russia (chapter 3) “Bolshevism was born in London in the summer of 1903 …”</p>
    <p><strong>The Scotsman – 22 November 1920</strong>

    <h3>The Soviets in 1925<sup>1</sup></h3>
    <p>A 48 page, very detailed, memorandum written by Edouard in January 1926, issued by the Anglo-Russian News (from 23-28 Fleet Street) and published by [XXX].</p>
    <p>Its aim was to provide <q>an independent review of Political, Economic and Social events in the USSR. [in 1925]</q></p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author17.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author18.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>The memorandum provides a significant amount of detail and data about the Russian economy, industrial output, the labour force, employment and wages and has sections on each of the main Industries. I am not going to attempt to try and summarise or even comment on many of these sections as the level of detail and financial analysis is too great.</p>
    <p>Instead, I have included below a number of extracts from certain sections of the document which I hope will provide some interesting information and capture the essence of the publication for the reader.</p>
    <p>It starts with an overview of the Governance structure of the USSR in 1925 and this is reproduced, for context and information purposes, in full below:</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author19.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>The Memorandum contains sections looking at:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Economic Year,</li>
      <li>The Political Year,</li>
      <li>The Social Year, and</li>

    <p>These extracts all make rather gloomy and indeed disturbing reading. Production levels were significantly down on pre-war levels and poverty across the country was very marked.</p>
    <p>On the domestic front, conditions were reaching desperate levels.</p>
    <p>On the foreign relations front the lines had been drawn by the Soviets and in particular, as noted below, the relations with Great Britain were at best “semi-friendly” and at worst (more prevalent perhaps when you consider the anti- British propaganda which was rife) “openly antagonistic”!</p>

    <h3>A Red Year – The Soviets in 1926</h3>
    <p>A 136 page book written by Edouard, published in March 1927 by the Anglo-Russian Press.</p>
    <p>It is described on the title page as <q>a record of Soviet life activities and intrigues at home and abroad during 1926.</q></p>
    <p>Note: It refers to the fact that the memorandum entitled “The Soviets in 1925” was received very favourably by the Press and its readers, but owing to its form and price its circulation was restricted. The form has therefore been changed to hopefully increase the circulation potential.</p>
    <p>It is full of fascinating quotes and pen and pencil drawings of the principal leaders.</p>
    <p>As this is such a substantial document I propose to summarise the Author’s Foreword and to highlight in brief detail the subject matters covered in the various chapter headings.</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author25.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <h4>Author’s Foreword (February 1927)</h4>
    <p>The material from which the book was compiled is derived entirely from official sources – trying to avoid his own partisanship coming through.</p>
    <p>The picture painted is of <q>Russia in her ordinary working clothes and manners, undisturbed by shyness or by the desire to impress foreign visitors.</q></p>
    <p>The picture is gloomy and sordid … Soviet policy and activities were predominantly anti-British.</p>
    <p>Edouard claims that:</p>
    <blockquote><p>“…. he is not a politician, either in the Russian or British sense. He belongs to no Party and subscribes to no programme; his sole desire is to show that the Soviet system, both politically and economically is unsound, not because I bear any malice to Soviet leaders, but because the results have turned a progressive country into a backward country.</p>
    <p>For years my work was devoted to the extension of Russian industry, commerce and finance in co-operation with this country [Britain]. I fought for modern ideas of commerce because I saw that, by coming into line with progressive European countries, Russia could become wealthier and happier.</p>
    <p>This book is, therefore, not “a plea for Czarism”, an accusation levelled against me by a Labour reviewer of my previous efforts, nor is it “a hazardous throw for intervention”, another accusation.</p>
    <p>It is to show that “antagonism of classes” must lead to “antagonism of nations” and that all antagonism is a social and economic evil.”</p></blockquote>
    <p>He concludes by saying that he hopes to issue another review next year!<sup>1</sup></p>

    <h3>Soviet Dumping</h3>
    <p>A 40 page document written by Edouard with a foreword by The Rt. Hon. Lord Newton, P.C.,<sup>1</sup> published by the Anglo-Russian Press Association in 1931 costing one shilling.</p>
    <p>It is described on the title page as a <q>summary of the economic war activities and the latest attempts made by the Soviet Government of Russia against the welfare of the civilised world.</q></p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author27.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <h4>Foreword</h4>
    <p>A very clear explanation of the concepts and dangers of ‘Soviet Dumping’.</p>
    <p>Lord N highlights the dangers that the B political campaign against Britain would be supplemented by an industrial attack which, if successful, would go far towards undermining Britain’s economic position.</p>
    <p>He describes Soviet Russia as a slave state, a gigantic internment camp in which 150 million humans are confined and the Government exercises despotic control…. the whole of the nation being effectively militarised, treating the workers as soldiers and dispatching them to which ever place their labour maybe required…. paid a minimum wage or nothing at all.</p>
    <p>So the Soviet Govt enjoys the advantage of unlimited labour supply, immunity from strikes and an almost negligible cost of production.</p>
    <p>…. thus the Soviet Govt has acquired factories, mines, forests, lands etc all for nothing by stealing them, can employ skilled foreign experts alongside mass labour at little cost. The result: they can dump goods in Europe at prices substantially lower than they are charging in Russia – the aim: to disorganise and disrupt international trade and prices , promote trade disputes abroad and increase unemployment levels in Europe – all helped in Britain by the Free Trade principles being followed. This could all help strengthen the spread of Bolshevism abroad – dangerous.</p>
    <h4>An International Problem</h4>
    <p>Soviet dumping threatens to undermine the whole fabric of international commerce and economics – selling goods to foreigners at a price far below that charged to their own people.</p>
    <p>Commodities dumped by the Soviet Government are produced by the ‘omnipotent’ State on nationalised land or in confiscated factories, mines and works, or are obtained from its subjects at fixed prices regulated by the State and paid for in State printed currency which has no purchasing power outside the State. They are then transported on confiscated railways and inland water ways and loaded by convict, forced and ill-paid labour. The only real cost, in addition to the low cost of keeping the workers alive, is the charter of foreign ships in real foreign currency usually paid by the foreign buyer.</p>
    <p>Example: In 1930 butter cost 19s 6d a pound in Moscow BUT sold in London for as low as 11 1/2d a pound !</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author28.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <h4>Organised Dumping</h4>
    <p>This practice intensified in 1930 – exporting goods where there was a serious shortage in Russia itself, where the Russian people were in desperate need !]</p>
    <p>Example: In 1930 the Soviets resumed the export of cereals on a large scale whilst at the same time establishing a strict system of rationing at home.</p>
    <h4>Dumping in Britain</h4>
    <p>Evidence is overwhelming.</p>
    <p>Goods to the value of £165m are estimated to have been dumped into Britain during the period 1920 – 29.</p>
    <p>Example: £4m of eggs dumped into Britain whilst the government ration for a fully qualified Communist is 1/3 of an egg per day !</p>
    <p>Soviet commodities were sold at levels between 5% and 25% below all other prices.</p>
    <h4>Economic War</h4>
    <p>In 1918 all foreign trading throughout Russia was declared a State Monopoly – the Russian merchant effectively ceased to exist.</p>
    <p>….. “the basis of our foreign trade policy is monopoly … and is one of the chief weapons for the regulation of our domestic market.”</p>
    <p>The Foreign Trade Monopoly was to be used in the class war against the Capitalist system, the rich and protected countries … with Russian domestic industry at the same time being protected by high import tariffs.</p>
    <p>Stalin is clever and well informed …. using the dumping approach he aims to create conditions of instability in world markets which he hopes may lead to world revolution.</p>
    <h4>British Trade and Russia</h4>
    <p>Soviet exports were financed by English banks for ¼ of the total value, ¼ as advances from brokers and a 1/3 of the remainder derived from other British sources – so 66% of the value of goods dumped in Britain were financed long before they even reached British shores.</p>
    <h4>Soviet Slavery</h4>
    <p>Estimated that the real value of the average weekly wage of the town worker amounts to 11s 3d a week – worse off than the average unemployed man with a wife and three children on unemployment pay in England !!</p>
    <p>The Soviet Labour Code allowed the State to call up citizens between the ages of 18 and 45 for compulsory labour service – two years of continuous active work in industrial undertakings.</p>
    <p>Unemployment was abolished as were public holidays, no freedom of movement of labour, women were mobilised and prison labour was utilised heavily.</p>
    <h4>Motives behind Dumping</h4>
    <p>Dumping was not new but Soviet dumping was different – aim to manipulate market relations, strike at capitalist stabilisation, disorganise the economic order – ultimately to assist in instigating World Revolution – whilst enslaving its own people.</p>
    <h4>Defensive Measures</h4>
    <p>The need to stop the financing of Soviet exports, stop the provision of the credits helping Stalin, increase the use of import controls and tariffs.</p>
    <p>See Edouard’s booklet entitled “Can we trade with Russia?”.</p>

    <h3>Can we Trade with Russia?</h3>
    <p>A 48 page booklet written by Edouard in 1929, published by the Anglo-Russian Press costing one shilling.</p>
    <p>It is described on the title page as : <q>an analysis of Anglo-Soviet trade possibilities as revealed by the economic conditions of Soviet Russia, together with a suggestion for the legitimate extension of British exports.</q></p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author29.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <h4>Preface</h4>
    <p>Investigation concludes that “Soviet policy – and that alone – is responsible both for the present insignificant volume of trade and for the difficulties experienced whenever Britain has tried to revive and extend that trade.</p>
    <h4>The Dilemma</h4>
    <p>Political – how to establish normal commercial relations with a country that has openly proclaimed a state of militant antagonism towards the rest of the world?</p>
    <p>Economic – how to adjust the economic machinery and methods obtaining in the rest of the world to the peculiar and unreciprocal conditions in Soviet Russia?</p>
    <p>PLUS: Britain has been especially singled out by the Soviet Government as an objective of hatred and interference !!</p>
    <p>Russia pleads for trade credits whilst refusing to settle old debts !</p>
    <h4>British Efforts</h4>
    <p>Many and varied attempts to try and ‘stretch out a helping hand to Russia’ – treaties, conferences, delegations, debt settlement proposals, offers of credits, freedom to establish trading companies in London etc, etc – at the British Government and individual trader level.</p>
    <p>However, Russia now follows an economic despotism regime known as Foreign Trade Monopoly - i.e. all foreign trade is in the hands of the Soviet Government. – really another war measure against World Capitalism. The suspension of the law of supply and demand.</p>
    <p>Aims at keeping foreign manufacturers and traders out of Russia, whilst claiming free entry and all facilities for free trading for itself and its officials in every other country in the world.</p>
    <p>Russia requires the granting of trade credits but cannot show a sound economic or commercial position for this - defaulting on debts, breaking treaties, confiscating British properties and businesses in Russia.</p>
    <p>Agriculture is still the only real basis of the country’s economy – industrialisation has not really taken off – home demand has collapsed due to the poverty of the people.</p>
    <blockquote><p>“We have electricity! We have ‘Lenin’s Lamp’ so that we can see ourselves starve”</p></blockquote>
    <p>However, the focus shifts to investing in building up heavy industry at the expense of light industry and the worsening conditions of the peasants – forced industrialisation takes all available money and credits whilst agricultural production falls and money is not available for everyday items!</p>
    <h4>Anglo-Soviet trade</h4>
    <p>Russia ends up importing less from all countries as she has less money to spend abroad – however, the British share of the loss has in fact been less than most other more favoured countries.</p>
    <h4>Trade Possibilities</h4>
    <p>Real trade orders in the Engineering, Chemical and Textile industries are possible but not thought to be large; hypothetical orders for industrial equipment would only be possible if Britain was prepared to grant huge loans and credits – but why should we do this?</p>
    <p>Would it help reduce British unemployment numbers – even Churchill admits this would not actually occur – or at best would be a mere bagatelle in the face of 1 ½ million unemployed.</p>
    <p>Statistics have been produced showing that the British public would need to put up £142 - !90m of credits in order to secure £30 to £40m of Russian orders to relieve unemployment !!</p>
    <h4>So how to extend trade?</h4>
    <p>Concludes that the state of the Russian economy is precarious and capacity to import freely is seriously diminished – the market is artificially controlled and Russia’s desire to industrialise itself dominates the whole programme of imports. Add to that the fact that Britain is an acknowledged enemy!</p>
    <p>The Soviets sell products in Britain of £20m a year but only buy £3m a year.</p>
    <p>The answer – an arrangement whereby exports of British products to Russia should be more or less equivalent to the value of Soviet exports to Britain plus a system whereby the Soviets have to deposit a % of the value of their exports to Britain as security for fulfilment of making British purchases – these deposits to be held in the British banking system.</p>

    <h3>Economic Russia: 1932: an authentic report for 1931 together with a review of Soviet plans and prospects for 1932</h3>
    <p>A 23 page booklet written by Edouard in 1932, published by the <span class="pubTitles">Anglo-Russian Press Association</span>.</p>
    <p>It provides “a general economic survey of Soviet Russia three years in to the Five Year Plan.”</p>
    <p>It covers Industrial Production, Soviet Agriculture, Labour, Wages & Cost of Living, Foreign Trade and a summary of the Soviet economic programme for 1932.</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author30.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>Rather surprisingly for Edouard this booklet is more upbeat and positive about the Soviet economy and what has been achieved during 1931 and admits that significant progress has been made.</p>
    <p>It concludes that although levels of production will be below plan in 1932, the last year of the Five Year Plan, these lower levels will be seen to be acceptable.</p>
    <p>He then warns the reader that this level of progress is likely to result in Soviet Russia “gaining strength for her campaign of aggression against the rest of the world”!</p>

    <h4><em>with a Foreword by Lord Sydenham of Combe</em><sup>1</sup></h4>
    <p>A 31 page document published by the Anglo-Russian Economic Society in 1933 with an introduction by Lord Sydenham of Combe.</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author32.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>An extract from this foreword best describes the content and objective of this memorandum.</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author33.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
    <p>This is yet another ‘thought piece’ by Edouard on the complex subject of Anglo-Russian trade, an area of expertise for Edouard whose specialist subject can be seen to be economic trade – working with substantial amounts of raw data, showing his ability to analyse such primary data and present…</p>
    <p>Of particular note and interest is Edouard’s radical proposition and theory that ‘ecomomic barter’ could be the solution to adjusting the trade balance between the two countries.</p>
    <p><img src="./resources/images/author34.jpg" alt="DESCRIPTION HERE" style="max-width:100%;"> WITH AN OVAL CIRCLE THING (see pdf)</p>

          <br>“Thus, in terminating the Temporary Agreement (1921 & 1930) the British Government has merely denounced an arrangement which operated in favour of only one party to the transaction.”</td>

          <br>Edouard makes the strong assertion that “Britain’s policy should be that trade must be balanced by goods and not by gold or credits”.
